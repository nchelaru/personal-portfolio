A while ago, I was trying to integrate a recipe search functionality into my grocery shopping dashboard. To get Google search results programmatically, I found this code snippet by the Stack Overflow user <b>mbdevpl</b> using the [Python client library for Google's discovery based APIs](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client):

```{r eval=T, echo=F}
library(reticulate)
use_python('/Users/nancy/miniconda3/bin/python')
```


```{python, eval=F, echo=T} 
## Import libraries
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

## Set credentials
my_api_key = "API_key" 
my_cse_id = "CSE_ID"

## Define function
def google_search(search_term, api_key, cse_id, **kwargs):
    service = build("customsearch", "v1", developerKey=api_key)
    res = service.cse().list(q=search_term, cx=cse_id, **kwargs).execute()
    return res['items']
```

<b>mbdevpl</b> provided very detailed [instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37083058/programmatically-searching-google-in-python-using-custom-search) for setting up and querying the Google Custom Search Engine (be sure to follow *all* the steps in the answer). Creating your own [Google custom search engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/) and [Google API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) is free.

As an example, if I want to look up a recipe that can uses up the peaches, turmeric, milk and spinach in my fridge:

```{python, eval=F, echo=T}
## Generate search terms
ing_list = ['peaches', 'turmeric', 'milk', 'spinach']

search_term = '+'.join(ing_list)

## Make query, limit to 10 results
results = google_search(search_term, my_api_key, my_cse_id, num=10)
```

```{python, eval=T, echo=F}
import pickle 

with open("./gsc_results.pickle", 'rb') as f:
    results = pickle.load(f)
    results = results[0]
```

The search results are returned as a list of dictionaries. We can quickly look at one of them:

```{python, eval=T, echo=T}
from pprint import pprint

pprint(results[2], indent=2)
```


Here is how to grab bits of information that I want from each dictionary and put them into a `pandas` dataframe:

```{python}
## Import library
import pandas as pd

## Create empty dataframe with desired columns
df = pd.DataFrame(columns = ['Title', 'URL', 'Description', 'Image'])

## Append results to dataframe row by row
for result in results:
  df = df.append({'Title':result['title'], 
                  'Description':result['snippet'],
                  'Image':result['pagemap']['cse_image'][0]['src'],
                  'URL':result['formattedUrl']},
                 ignore_index=True)
```


As a quick demonstration, the R package `kableExtra` can produce very sleek tables in which the image URLs can be rendered as images. Of course, much more styling can be done to prepare the content for an actual application.

```{r message=FALSE}
## Import libraries
library(dplyr, quietly = T)
library(knitr, quietly = T)
library(kableExtra)

## Import dataframe variable from Python runtime
df <- py$df

## Preprocess the image links to allow rendering
df$Image = sprintf('![](%s)', df$Image)

## Hyperlink the titles 
df$Title = sprintf("[%s](%s)", df$Title, df$URL)

## Drop the URL column
df$URL <- NULL

kable(df) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T) %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "20em")
```

The data obtained can also be used for much more, like text processing and image recognition.

Have fun with it! :)
